	<p class="abt"> A simple girl full of curiosities..Programming my life into a better one day by day.. Endlessly exploring new stuff and Trying to maintain the syntax order of my codes and the LIFE as well..
	<br><br>I am an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Information Technology (Allahabad). I am passionate about programming.I am an amateur poet too and also love calligraphy.I firmly believe that in every situation, no matter how difficult, God extends grace greater than the hardship, and strength and peace of mind that can lead us to a place higher than where we were before. 
	<br><br>Though I am not a teen anymore(that's sad),I still love Minions.
	Thus, childish at heart but mature enough to tackle any situation with brains.
    So,this was all about me.
	I am glad that u came this far and read this whole boring stuff about me :p <br>
	P.S. Hey,I forgot to mention that I am a cat lover.. Mewwww.
